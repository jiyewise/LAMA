Please refer to the original repo for details. 

# fairmotion

fairmotion provides easy-to-use interfaces and tools to work with motion capture data. The objective of the library is to manage the complexity of motion representation, 3D transformations, file formats and visualization, and let users focus on high level learning tasks. 

Users can take advantage of large high-quality motion capture datasets like the [CMU](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/) and [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/) datasets without deep knowledge of the domain or handling the idiosyncrasies of individual datasets. We implement baselines for research tasks using building blocks from the library to demonstrate its utility.

## Getting Started

### Installation

farmotion is available on PyPI for easy installation
```
pip install fairmotion
```

To install fairmotion from source, first clone the git repository, use pip to download dependencies and build the project.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairmotion.git
$ cd fairmotion
$ pip install -e .
```
### Data Loading

Here, we load a motion capture file in the BVH file format in a python console. Similarly, there are loaders to import files from [ASF/AMC](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/cs-838-1999/Jeff/ASF-AMC.html), [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/dataset) and [AMASS DIP](http://dip.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/pre_download) formats.
```
from fairmotion.data import bvh

BVH_FILENAME = “PATH_TO_BVH_FILE”
motion = bvh.load(BVH_FILENAME)
```

If you recieve errors like the ones below, you can find the workaround [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65202395/pyopengl-on-macos-bigsur-and-opengl-error-nullfunctionerror#:~:text=if%20name%20%3D%3D%20%27OpenGL%27%3A%0A%20%20%20%20fullName%20%3D%20%27/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/OpenGL%27%0Aelif%20name%20%3D%3D%20%27GLUT%27%3A%0A%20%20%20%20fullName%20%3D%20%27/System/Library/Frameworks/GLUT.framework/GLUT%27).
```
ImportError: ('Unable to load OpenGL library', 'dlopen(OpenGL, 10): image not found', 'OpenGL', None)
or
OpenGL.error.NullFunctionError: Attempt to call an undefined function glutInit, check for bool(glutInit) before calling
```
### Motion manipulation

The motion object can be manipulated in both modular and matrix forms. Here, we translate the object to a fixed global position `[1, 1, 1]` and select a time slice from frame `20` to frame `30`.
```
from fairmotion.ops import motion as motion_ops

translated_motion = motion_ops.translate(motion, np.array([1, 1, 1]))
sliced_motion = motion_ops.cut(translated_motion, 10, 20)
```
We can perform the same operations in the matrix representation of motion.
```
from fairmotion.core.motion import Motion

# motion_matrix has shape (num_frames, num_joints, 4, 4) where 4x4 is transformation matrix
motion_matrix = motion.to_matrix()

translation_matrix = np.zeros((4, 4))
translation_matrix[3, :3] = np.array([1, 1, 1])

translated_motion_matrix = motion_matrix + translation_matrix
sliced_motion_matrix = translated_motion_matrix[10:20]
sliced_motion = Motion.from_matrix(sliced_motion_matrix, motion.skel)
```
### Data saving

We can save the manipulated motion object back into the bvh file format for us to visualize the result.
```
NEW_BVH_FILENAME = "PATH_TO_NEW_BVH_FILE"
bvh.save(sliced_motion, NEW_BVH_FILENAME)
```
### Visualization

We visualize the results using the `bvh_visualizer` tool.
```
$ python fairmotion/viz/bvh_visualizer.py --bvh-files $NEW_BVH_FILENAME
```
